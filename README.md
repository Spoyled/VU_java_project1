# Sorting Program

This is a Java program that can sort a list of objects of any type using a QuickSort algorithm. The program demonstrates the use of a custom sorting algorithm and provides an example of how to work with generic data types in Java.

## Features

- Sorts a list of objects of any type
- Demonstrates the use of custom sorting algorithms
- Provides an example of working with generic data types in Java

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system. You can download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
